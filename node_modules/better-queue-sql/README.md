# Better Queue - SQL Store

A SQL store for [better-queue](https://github.com/diamondio/better-queue).


### Getting started

Install this store with npm:
```bash
npm install --save better-queue-sql
```

Configure your queue to use the sql store:
```js
var q = new Queue(fn, {
  store: {
    type: 'sql',
    ... more options here
  }
})
```

... or instantiate it and pass it to the store directly:

```js
var SQLStore = require('better-queue-sql');
var store = new SQLStore(opts);
var q = new Queue(fn, { store: store })
```

### Examples

Please have a look at the [better-queue](https://github.com/diamondio/better-queue) documentation on how to set up and use stores.
